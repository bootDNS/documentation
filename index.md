</p>

bootDNS is a modern & open source DNS management, which is aiming to simplify the way of managing your BIND9 authoritative nameservers.

Some of our main features are:

* **API**: Allows for automation and integrate into your desired workflows and systems.
* **Audit**: Logging all changes, so you know who to point fingers at.
* **CheckZone**: Validation of DNS records for every change. So we don't push invalid zones into the world.
* **DNSSEC**: Build-in support for DNSSEC made easy with just the flip of a switch.
* **RBAC**: Security is everything today. Ensure people have the needed permissions for daily operation. Even as API, Local or LDAP user.
* **Statistics**: Overview over all queries made towards your zones, or export them to your favorite logging-system.
